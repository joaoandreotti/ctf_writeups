64bit elf
checksec:
  RELRO:    Partial RELRO
  Stack:    Canary found
  NX:       NX enabled
  PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)

staticaly linked
although canary is found, the function main doesnt have it
just a basic rop without bigger problem
a lil trick here is to write '/bin/sh' into .bss, this way I can have the pointer to '/bin/sh'

setting bss value to rdi
  pop_rdi
  .bss addr
setting '/bin//sh/' to rsi
  pop_rsi
  '/bin//sh'
then
  mov qwort ptr [rdi], rsi, ret

and the basic rop to call system
