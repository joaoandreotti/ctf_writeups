32bit elf

checksec:
  RELRO:    Full RELRO
  Stack:    No canary found
  NX:       NX enabled
  PIE:      PIE enabled

there is no canary, but pie and nx are enabled and is is Full RELRO

code works like this:
  int a=0;
  char buf[20];
  gets(buf);
  check(a);

check return flag is a != 0
overwrite a variable value

disas main:
  DWORD PTR [ebp-0xc]
  call   0x123c <check>

'ebp-0xc' == pointer to 'a' variable value, changing this to anywhere that holds any value other then 0 should be enough
overflowing 20 chars the pointer to 'a' starts to be overwritten, a random 32bit value that points to a non 0 number
print ('a'*20 + 'random')
