disas main:
  lea rax, [rbp-0x20] ; 32 == 8(?) + 24(buffer size)
  mv rdi, rax
  call gets

gets is prone to bof as it doesnt check for boundary
anything bigger then 40 is going to overwrite rip
0-7(?)
8-31(buff)
32-39(rbp)
40-47(rip)

checksec bof:
  RELRO:    Partial RELRO
  Stack:    No canary found
  NX:       NX enabled
  PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)

there is a function win() that calls /bin/sh and no PIE
change the return address and boom

using python + pwn to make things easy and done
