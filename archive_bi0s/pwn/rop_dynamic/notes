this is where ret2libc come into play
first of all it is needed to leak libc

leaking some values of __libc_start_main, printf and etc
then going on libc.blukat.me and type the values

then download the libc, and using pwntools open with pwn.ELF
ASLR is probably on, to bypass this
leak the value of __libc_start_main again, but this time return to <main+0>
then, get the addr of libc and set to its new offset

now it's just the basic ret2libc

leaked libc using __libc_start_main and gets from .got:
  libc6_2.28-10_amd64

downloading and creating a specific exploit to this libc
done!
