searching for and exploit to rce
apparently there is more, that answer to the question in thm isn`t ms12-020
it was ms17-010, i went by reading all ms**-*** scripts in nmap documentation and searched for the fit with this server
it is a lot harder to not RCE this server than to RCE...
the thm questions imply that it is needed to use metasploit-framework...
it is what it is
what... already root?
whoami
nt authority\system
using hashcat to crack Jon passwd
using `dir "\flag*" /s` to find all flags
