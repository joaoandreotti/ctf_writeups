in 80:/development found a file telling -J that it have a weak password
loggin into anonymous smb and found a staff.txt file
two users found -Kay and -Jan
Jan probably is the one who has the weak password
using hydra + rockyou wordlist to bruteforce into Jen password
found user armando
found readable private ssh key
found comment on public ssh key that it isn`t necessary to type long passwords anymore
must be a weak pass on private key
bruteforcing with john
kudos!
unfortunatly the user password isn`t yet available
uid=1000(kay) gid=1000(kay) groups=1000(kay),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),110(lxd),115(lpadmin),116(sambashare)
possible to read logs or execute lxd without sudo
executing linpeas again
pkexec is SUID, it can be used to execute e root shell
found a pass.bak file in home with plain text password
to pkexec just use the password
kudos!

if the password wasn`t provided
create an alpine linux lxd container on host machine and then import the container file to target
using lxc to create a container with securite.privileged flag with true
mount the target filesystem on /mnt/ of the container image with recursive=true
starting and accessing the target container
now in /mnt/ on the container the entire filesystem of target will be there
any changes in /mnt/ be made in real filesystem
using openssl to generate new root password and then pasting in passwd pass section
kudos!
