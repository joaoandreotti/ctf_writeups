done!

---PRIVESC---
there is a mysql running

*./linpeas.sh:
  (writable files)
  /usr/local/bin
  /usr/local/games
  /usr/local/sbin

*./pspy64:
  */bin/sh -c /root/bin/cleanup.pl >/dev/null 2>&
  -when loggin in from another ssh terminal:
    */bin/sh /etc/update-motd.d/10-uname
    *sh -c /usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin run-parts --lsbsysinit /etc/update-motd.d > /run/motd.dynamic.new
*cat /etc/update-motd.d/10-uname:
  #!/bin/sh
  uname -rnsom

in PATH variable /usr/local/sbin is the first priority and the logged user can write into it. The uname command isnt hard pathed, so creating a new uname file that executes a reverse shell should do the trick.
kudos!
*cat /root/root.txt
