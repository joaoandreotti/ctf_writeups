to find the username just print slither var
to find the password just check how the encryption works
first part is a bunch of keys xoring with 0x5
  the first part keys is: password!!
second part is a bunch of keys adding with 0xA
  the second part keys is: this is a troll

trying the whole password didnt work on htb
trying the encrypted first part because it is encrypted by 'password!!'
done!
