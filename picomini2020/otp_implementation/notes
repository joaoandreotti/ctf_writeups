each char of key must be a hex one (0-9, a-f)

function jumble (char c1):
  if c1 == number:
    c1 += 9
  c1 *= 2
  return c1 + 1

a way to solve is get the string that it is comparing (jbgkfmgkknbiblpmibgkcneiedgokibmekffokamknbkhgnlhnajeefpekiefmjgeogjbflijnekebeokpgngjnfbimlkdjdjhan) and do the reverse operations
easy to brute too, decompile the program, get the code and print the generated flag, if true then BOOOOM
complexity is O(16 * 100), nothing

a decompiled version of the program is created
a little modification is to print the current encoded value to check if it is right
python script to solve
then, XOR with the flag ("You got the key, congrats! Now xor it with the flag!")
