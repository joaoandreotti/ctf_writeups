the encryption is made by a basic pattern, this can be easily found if the typed message to encrypt is aaaa or 0123.
The encryption code will be something like this:
  msg = "james"
  i = 0
  ans = ""
  for x in msg:
    ans += chr (ord (x) + i)
    i += 1
  print (ans)
to decrypt just subtract (ord (x) - i) instead of adding
