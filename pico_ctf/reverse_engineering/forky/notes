mmap ();
  If addr is NULL, then the kernel chooses the (page-aligned) address at which to create the mapping
  The length argument specifies the length of the mapping
  The prot argument describes the desired memory protection of the mapping
  The flags argument determines whether updates to the mapping are visible to other processes mapping the same region, and whether updates are carried through to the underlying file.
  The contents of a file mapping (as opposed to an anonymous mapping; see MAP_ANONYMOUS below), are initialized using length bytes starting at offset offset in the file (or other object) referred to by the file descriptor fd.

mmap has nothing to do with it

a pointer to a integer (var1) is written in its value 1000000000, then 4 fork () calls, which result in 16 calls to (*var1 = *var1 + 0x499602d2). This causes an overflow, so to solve this is just call a print in c to this expression
