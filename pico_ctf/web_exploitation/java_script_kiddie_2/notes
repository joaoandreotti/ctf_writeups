the code is almost the same as before
the difference is the key size which is 32 and 'shifter = Number(key.slice((i*2),(i*2)+1));' (all the [0, 2, 4 .. 30] positions)
using the same python script as before with this little change
the bytes array changed too
the key is actualy 16 in size, the odd positions are ignored, and this time is only ascii numbers ('0', .., '9')
get the qrcode and decrypt
