if is was a local program, just patch the if that checks if the number is types and solved

a = rand();
a = a & 0xf; hex(0xf) == bin(1111)
scanf ("%d", b);
if (a != b) break;

brute probably wont work chance are  (1/16) ** 30

trying to sync up with the server time, the server set the seed with time(0), this returns time since epoch
the idea to solve is get the host time (0) and sub an offset to it and set the seed, seed (time (0) - offset)
the time that the server started the program must the less then the host one, obviously
using python random module doesnt work
using the ctypes modules instead
done
